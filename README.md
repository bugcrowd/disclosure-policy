This Framework is maintained by [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com) and [CipherLaw](https://www.cipherlawgroup.com/). It is designed to quickly and smoothly prepare your organization to work with the independent security researcher community while reducing the legal risks to researchers and companies. The policy itself has been written with both simplicity and legal completeness in mind.
