## Welcome to the Open Source Coordinated Disclosure Framework

This Framework is maintained by [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com) and [CipherLaw](https://www.cipherlawgroup.com/). It is designed to quickly and smoothly prepare your organization to work with the independent security researcher community while reducing the legal risks to researchers and companies. The policy itself has been written with both simplicity and legal completeness in mind.

=============================

Bugcrowd lets companies run responsible disclosure programs using our Crowdcontrol platform for free. Crowdcontrol securely manages the vulnerability submission process, all communications with the researcher, and provides an automated Hall of Fame for you to credit those who've helped you.
